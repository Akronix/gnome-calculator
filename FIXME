Gcalctool 

* Has Rate and Term (financial mode) same shortkey?


Gcalctool - Next Generation FIXME (Arithmetic Precedence (AP) mode)
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Editing calctool.h does not seem to make compiler to recompile.

* CE parser has 2 reduce/reduce errors

* Financial function usage in AP (arithmetic precedence) mode has not 
  been thought throughly.

* bug 138875

* Answer cannot be used in logical calculations because answer may not
  be integer.

* Base conversions are not easy to use. (Only answer can be converted)

* If you do
  78/0=
  
    it displays "Error" correctly, but the following menu items are activated:
    View->Use Arithmetic Precedence
    View->Show Thousands Separator
