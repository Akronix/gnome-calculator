Gcalctool - Next Generation FIXME (Arithmetic Precedence (AP) mode)
------------------------------------------------------------------

* % is not implemented.

* ()Editing calctool.h does not seem to make compiler to recompile.

* CE parser has 2 reduce/reduce errors

* Menu selections related to AP are not saveable

* No recovery if keys are locked by an error.

* Financial function usage in AP (arithmetic precedence) mode has not 
  been thought throughly.
