Calctool TODO.
==============

Related to the Gtk2 version:

Must Fix.
---------
* Make sure everything is setup correctly for I18N/L10N.
* Make it work correctly with Gtk themes.
* Testing of an invalidly entered constant with sscanf() in cfframe_apply_cb()
  doesn't seem to be working.
* Shouldn't use X resources. Probably need to use gconf, but maybe Gtk 
  resources, in which case see:
  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-resource-files.html
  http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/ch-gtkrcfiles.html
* The size of the buttons in the logical mode window is incorrect.
  Problem is in make_mtable() and is due to the GtkAttachOptions options
  used in the gtk_table_attach() call. Setting them to 0 for non-visible
  buttons correctly initially draws them, but doesn't allow resizing to work
  correctly. Checkout GtkSizeGroup.
* The + and . keys on the numeric keypad don't work.
  (See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79184)
* Keyboard accelerators don't seem to work for menu buttons.
* Need to add in Help key support (or tooltip help). Can probably use the
  text from the calctool.info file in the XView distribution.
 
Would be nice. 
-------------- 
* To have a black line between bottom of mode/state labels and main keyboard 
  buttons, to cleanly delineate them.
* Need to align items in the various popups.

============================================================================

- Fixup all known bugs and rfe's.

- Consider the possibility of being able to have all the three mode windows
  pinnable at the same time.

- As of V3.0.1., calctool was modified to have "infinite" precision
  internally. This needs to be made available to the "power" users, but
  shouldn't confuse the novice. What I suggest is to replace the Acc
  button menu, with an Acc... button which brings up a popup with a slider
  on, to allow you to set the number of numeric places. By default this
  will be 0-9. I also propose adding another X resource, which will also
  allow you to set the number of numeric places. This value can be as
  large as you want. When calctool starts up, it will look for that
  resource, and adjust the sliders maximum value appropriately.
 
  Making this addition will possibly cause the calctool numeric result to
  be larger that can fully displayed. There are two possible ways to fix
  this:

  * make the display area a scrollable canvas.
  * make the calctool numeric display a panel text item of the appropriate
    length.

MP - todo.
----------

* Everytime the accuracy is changed, the menu items in the constant
  menu should be reevaluated to that new accuracy value.

* Shouldn't have to convert back to a double in make_number() in order
  to test if the number is too large to be displayed in fixed point.

* The cmax field for make_fixed should be dynamic, and depend upon how
  many characters can be displayed (ie. a larger calctool will be able
  to display more).

* Tidy up the code in mp.c, to eventually use no labels and goto's.

* Adjust all uses of MP...[MP_SIZE] to use a dynamic size so that it's
  possible to calculate to numbers of any length.


Possible enhancements.
----------------------

* Add in the ability to drag & drop from/to the display and the memory
  registers.

* Add some more functions:

  ~ Common antilogarithm and natural antilogarithm.
  ~ Cube root key.
  ~ Root key. The y root of x.
  ~ Rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular keys.

* Add Reverse Polish notation functionality (as an option).
