Gcalctool TODO.
===============

* Navigation with the arrow keys is a little haywire. This looks like it's
  bug 60690 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60690).

* If gcalctool is initially displayed in Financial or Scientific mode, the
  Basic Mode radio item is set in the View menu.

* With the gcalctoolrc Gtk resources copied to a ~/.gcalctoolrc file, the 
  "*displayitem*" widget and the "*register_label<n>*" widgets background 
  color aren't being set to white.

* Need to create help files for gcalctool. Breda McColgan will be working 
  on this.

* Need to reduce tool tip help message sizes. Will do this when the help
  files are in place.

* Make sure that this new gcalctool is fully accessible.

* Improve the colors in the gcalctoolrc file.

* Track down and fixup any memory leaks.

* Now that constant and function definitions are read/written as Gconf
  resources, there are three pieces of functionality that are no longer
  present. Need to be consider whether we wish to reimplement them. They
  are:
  - ability to read new constant/function definitions from a .gcalctoolcf
    file in the current directory, which override the ones in the users
    home directory.
  - ability to set initial values for the ten memory registers.
  - ability to extensively comment the definitions in the file.

* Implement bugtraq rfe #1190372/#1105626.
  It appears that function definitions are unable to handle all calculator
  buttons. Buttons with a keyboard equivalent that is a special key (clear 
  display) or key combination (^s - Sin) appear to be rejected in functions 
  defs.  This affects the availability of many of the calculator buttons.

* Implement bugtraq rfe #4023507.
  The calculator in Scientific mode accepts hex entries of up to
  eight digits.  This was sufficient to deal with 32-bit addresses.
  When Solaris is 64-bit, the calculator will be less useful.
  Maybe there should be a Logical-64 mode.

* Implement bugtraq rfe #4113441.
  Scientists using dtcalc under CDE would like to get deeper precision.
  The maximum accuracy depth, which is 9, is not enough for them.
  They would like to have 15 digits available.

* Implement bugtraq rfe #1122089.
  Add a log base 2 key.

* Consider the possibility of being able to have all the mode windows
  displayed at the same time.

* As of v3.0.1. calctool was modified to have "infinite" precision
  internally. This needs to be made available to the "power" users, but
  shouldn't confuse the novice. What I suggest is to replace the Acc
  button menu, with an Acc... button which brings up a popup with a slider
  on, to allow you to set the number of numeric places. By default this
  will be 0-9. I also propose adding another X resource, which will also
  allow you to set the number of numeric places. This value can be as
  large as you want. When calctool starts up, it will look for that
  resource, and adjust the sliders maximum value appropriately.
 
  Making this addition will possibly cause the calctool numeric result to
  be larger that can fully displayed. There are two possible ways to fix
  this:

  * make the display area a scrollable canvas.
  * make the calctool numeric display a panel text item of the appropriate
    length.

* Consider adding in the ability to drag & drop from/to the display and 
  the memory registers.
 
* Consider adding in some more functions:
 
  ~ Common antilogarithm and natural antilogarithm.
  ~ Cube root key.
  ~ Root key. The y root of x.
  ~ Rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular keys.
   
* Consider adding Reverse Polish notation functionality (as an option).


MP - todo.
----------

* Shouldn't have to convert back to a double in make_number() in order
  to test if the number is too large to be displayed in fixed point.

* The cmax field for make_fixed should be dynamic, and depend upon how
  many characters can be displayed (ie. a larger calctool will be able
  to display more).

* Tidy up the code in mp.c, to eventually use no labels and goto's.

* Adjust all uses of MP...[MP_SIZE] to use a dynamic size so that it's
  possible to calculate to numbers of any length.
