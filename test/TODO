* Currently you need to terminate the tests by pressing F12. This should
  happen automatically.

* With play_keystrokes.py: allow comment lines starting with '#' to be
  read (and ignored) in the input file. When comparing input with output,
  a simple sed command would be needed to remove the comment lines first.

* Fully intergrate into the gcalctool distribution. Currently the files
  are present in CVS, but aren't included with gcalctool tarball
  distributions.

* Provide an extensive input.txt file containing sample calculations to
  fully test all gcalctool functionality.

* Provide a wrapper script that automatically starts all three applications
  (and then automatically terminates gcalctool, when runtests.py has
   finished its tests).
