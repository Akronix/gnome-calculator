runtests.py:
------------

* Currently you need to terminate the tests by pressing F12. This should
  happen automatically.

* Not seeing a proper "object:text-changed:insert" event for gcalctool
  with non_aop_input.txt (except for the last line from the input file).


play_keystroke.py:
------------------

* Not correctly handling the Period token.

* Need to make sure it properly handles the Control-<char>, Alt-<char>
  etc. tokens at the beginning of the non_aop_input.txt file (currently
  these are commented out).


General:
--------

* Fully intergrate into the gcalctool distribution. Currently the files
  are present in CVS, but aren't included with gcalctool tarball
  distributions.

* Provide an extensive input.txt file containing sample calculations to
  fully test all gcalctool functionality.

* Provide a wrapper script that automatically starts all three applications
  (and then automatically terminates gcalctool, when runtests.py has
   finished its tests).
