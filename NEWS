----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.32

* Fixed bug 128603 again. The solution this time was to duplicate the 
  initial string constant values to be confident that they are not in 
  read-only memory.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.31

* Fixed bug 129539.  The thousands separator is a null terminated string,

* Fixed bug 129496. "Gradients" should be "Gradians".

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.29

* Fixed bug 128603. The changes for enhancement request #126626 which added 
  thousands separator support caused a crash at startup time on a Debian 
  system. The initial constant strings are being put in read-only memory 
  either by gcc (or because of the way that x86 arch is designed). This was 
  not a problem when tested with the Sun compilers on a Solaris SPARC machine.
  The remove_tsep() routine is display.c has been rewritten to correctly 
  handle this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.28

  input, the display will now show the thousands separator (if checked).

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.27

* On a Solaris keyboard, Shift-"^" is GDK_asciicircum/GDK_SHIFT_MASK.
  This keyval/state pair needed to be added to the Xor recognized mappings.

----

* Re-fixed bug 127672. The fix for Shift-"=" should have been for GDK_equal 
  not GDK_Return.  Needed to add in support for Shift-"/" too.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.25

* Implemented enhancement request 125873. gcalctool can now optionally 
  show the thousands seperator character for fixed point numbers displayed 
  in the decimal base. Same for numbers stored in the memory registers. 
  There is a new "Show Thousands Separator" menu entry in the View menu 
  to set this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.24

* Fixed bug 126626. gcalctool no longer causes a Gtk-CRITICAL error when 
  the user enters "9*(1<Xor>". The problem was caused because a non-UTF 
  character was being inserted into the text string to be displayed for 
  the Xor function.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.23

* Fixed bug 125782. If the user is entering a left parenthesis and it is 
  the first one being displayed and there is no current arithmetic operand,
  then the current display is initially cleared to avoid the confusion of 
  showing something like "0(".

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.22

* Fixed bug 127862. The fix for bug #125625 introduced a potential 
  out-of-order case for users who are rapid keyboard typers. This 
  bug fix rectifies this with the unfortunate side-effect of no longer 
  visual toggling the equivalent button to the keyboard character 
  that the user	entered. This fix is still compatible with the way 
  the accessibility infrastructure works though.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.21

* Fixed bug 65806. For the "1/x", "x^2", "x!", "e^x", "10^x" and 
  "y^x" labels, all occurances of "x" and "y" are now italicized.
  The "e" in "e^x" is no longer italicized.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.20

* Fixed bug 127316. The "fix" introduced in gcalctool v4.1.18 to fix Sun 
  Bugtraq bug #1258472 against CDE dtcalc (which was also a problem with 
  gcalctool) was incorrect.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.19

* Fixed bug 127672. The "=" key on a Swedish keyboard is on the upper 
  level of a key (i.e. the Shift key needs to be down). Added another 
  mask/keysym pair to the "=" entry to handle this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.18

* Fixed bug 125625. gcalctool now handles "clicked" events rather than 
  "pressed" ones.

  mask/keysym pair to the "+" entry to handle this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.14

* Fixed bug 120737. Changed the accessible text for the OR button from 
  "Logical OR" to "logical OR" so that it's not changed by FreeTTS's 
  token to words module to "logical Oregon".

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.13

* Fixed bug #123948. Removed the GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED flag from
  .../gcalctool/gcalctool/Makefile.am, to allow the depreciated
  GtkItemFactory, to successfully build.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.12

* Fixed bug 123724. Hitting Esc now does the same as hitting 
  Control-Backspace; i.e. the CE (clear entry) functionality.
* Updated the gcalctool man pages to reflect this change, and the changes
  for bug #118826.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.11

* Refixed bug 122373. gcalctool now uses nl_langinfo() to get the numeric 
  point for the users locale, rather than via a localised string.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.10

* Fixed enhancement #65806. Changed that label for e^x (e superscript x) to 
  use an italised "e".

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.9
