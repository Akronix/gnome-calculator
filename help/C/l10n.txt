GUI* TAGS AND SUPERSCRIPT
-------------------------

Several gcalctool buttons have a superscript label.
Currently, the <superscript> tag is not allowed within a <guibutton>, 
<guilabel>, or <guimenu> tag.
Therefore, any references to such gcalctool buttons are currently not embedded 
in <gui*> tags.
